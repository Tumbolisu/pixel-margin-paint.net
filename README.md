## Installation
Extract the contents of the ZIP archive to any folder. (It should be a DLL and a BAT file.)

Then simply double-click the BAT file to run it, which will install the DLL file for you.

You can savely remove the ZIP, DLL and BAT files afterwards.

## Usage
The plugin is found in the Effects tab, in the submenu "Object".

It has the following options:


#### Alpha Threshold
Pixels with an alpha-value less than this value will be overriden.

0 is not allowed as nothing would be affected.


#### Tile Horizontally/Vertically
Virtually repeat the image horizontally or vertically.

Useful for videogame textures.
